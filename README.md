## Features

Stratosphere Linux IPS, shortly Slips, is a Python-based intrusion prevention system that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in the network traffic. Slips was designed to focus on targeted attacks, to detect of command and control channels and to provide good visualisation for the analyst. Slips is able to analyze real live traffic from the device and the large network captures in the type of a pcap files, Suricata, Zeek/Bro and Argus flows. As a result, Slips highlights suspicious behaviour and connections that needs to be deeper analyzed. 

Slips is a modular software. Each module is designed to perform a specific detection in the network traffic. Current version of Slips contains following modules:

|   module  |   description | status |
| ---| --- | :-: |
| asn | loads and finds the ASN of each IP |✅|
| geoip | finds the country and geolocation information of each IP |✅|
| https | training&test of RandomForest to detect malicious https flows |✅|
| port scan detector | detects Horizontal and Vertical port scans |✅|
| threat Intelligence | checks if each IP is in a list of malicious IPs  |✅|
| timeline |  creates a timeline of what happened in the network based on all the flows and type of data available  |✅|
| rnn-cc-detection | detects command and control channels using recurrent neural network and the stratosphere behavioral letters |✅|
| VirusTotal | module to lookup IP address on VirusTotal |✅|
| flowalerts | module to find malicious behaviour in each flow. Current measures are: long duration of the connection, successful ssh |✅|
| blocking | module to block malicious IPs connecting to the device |⚠️|
| anomaly-detection | module to detect anomalies for conn.log files of zeek/bro |✅|


Slips has its own console graphical user interface called Kalipso. Kalipso summarizes the detections performed by Slips in colorful graphs and tables.

Complete documentation of Slips internal architecture and instructions how to implement a new module is available here: https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

### If you want to share files between your host and the docker, you can do:

	mkdir ~/dataset
	cp <some-place>/myfile.pcap ~/dataset
	docker run -it --rm --net=host -v ~/dataset:/StratosphereLinuxIPS/dataset stratosphereips/slips:latest
	./slips.py -c slips.conf -f dataset/myfile.pcap


## Build the docker from the Dockerfile

The easiest way to run Slips is inside a docker. Current version of Slips docker can analyze network captures (pcap, Zeek flows, Argus flows, etc.), but it is not able to analyze real live traffic. How to use Slips docker from DockerHub:

	cd docker
	docker build --no-cache -t slips -f Dockerfile .
	docker run -it --rm --net=host -v ~/code/StratosphereLinuxIPS/dataset:/StratosphereLinuxIPS/dataset slips
	./slips.py -c slips.conf -f dataset/test3.binetflow

You can now put pcap files or other flow files in the ./dataset/ folder and analyze them
